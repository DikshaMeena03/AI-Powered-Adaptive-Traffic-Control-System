# AI-Powered-Adaptive-Traffic-Control-System
This project introduces an AI-Powered Adaptive Traffic Control System designed to alleviate urban congestion. Leveraging a multi-faceted approach, the system integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for optimal signal timing, YOLO algorithms for real-time vehicle detection, and LSTM networks for predictive traffic flow analysis.
